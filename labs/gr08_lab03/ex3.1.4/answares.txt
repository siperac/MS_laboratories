How does the timing report changes with respect to the previous structure?

As we espected  the critical path of the windowed registerfile has an higher delay and it is
referred to the path betweern two sequential circuits  [Startpoint: cwp_reg[1]  Endpoint: WRF/OUT1_reg[6]] while in the first version
of the register file the delay considered only the delay of the register file.
